#Assignment 08
## Caleigh Moyer

1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?
I've never worked with html before, but it was a little bit difficult to navigate than the other assignments thus far.

2. Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?
I think i'm just excited to decorate in general since I love anything that has to do with design!

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
This assignment again was very time consuming, and I still struggled with a couple things but think I did okay for the most part. Just excited to learn more!
