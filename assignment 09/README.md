1. Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?
The universal selector selects everything in the document, the class selector selects everything in the document with that class applied to it, the id selector but is used in the same way as a class selector. However, an ID can be used only once per page, and elements can only have a single id applied to them. You pick which one to use based on what you are targeting in that specific "document" on the page.

2. Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.
I honestly kept the colors that were in the walkthrough video because I picked the theme of the 80's. I love the 80's and it's my favorite time period. Man, the things I would do to be my age in the late 80's when hard rock n roll was coming out!! I used yellow, pink, green, and blue. #FF377B, #7DE522, #FBE608, #3AB1FC.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
I liked this assignment, it was fun! But I did struggle with trying to add my background image. It was showing the text I had set out but not the image itself, but other than that, it was fine!
