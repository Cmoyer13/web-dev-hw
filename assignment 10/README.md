1. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?
Web safe fonts are fonts that can adapt to any browser on any device, web fonts are what instruct your site to render text in a particular font, and a system font are already installed on the computer.

2. What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?
It's important to have a fallback font or a font stack so that if your custom fonts don't render, web safe fonts provide a secondary option.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
This assignment was fun to do because I love fonts and always have a fun time picking out fonts for my tattoos, so it's going to be fun picking fonts for a webpage! I couldn't get the boarders on my page to work or don't know if I missed something, but it was fun to play with the colors and make the page all pretty!
