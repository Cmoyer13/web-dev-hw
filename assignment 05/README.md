1. You can have up to 6 levels of headings and you can only have one body tag. The head element is a container for metadata and is placed between the html and body tag.

2. The structural markup is an element that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs where a semantic markup provides extra information within the structural markup.

3. I still had difficulty adding an image to the website and couldn't figure out how to do it, but did the best I could. It's been fun learning how to code and create a website from scratch, and the walkthrough videos HELP SO MUCH! I appreciate you so much for putting those up for us. Still a difficult class to get the hang of since this is my first time ever doing something like this, but I'm trying my best!
