# Assignment 06
## Caleigh Moyer

1. Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?
Now that I know what a form is, now I see them "hidden" everywhere on other websites. Especially the online shopping websites! Its purpose is to collect user input and to see it's progress of things.
2. List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.
Text input is used to create what controls you want to use. You can create checkboxes with text input. The selected input is used to access a list of values, and the button input is used for content like images or text.
3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
This assignment was more time consuming than the others, but still learned more than I knew yesterday! It's fun seeing how a webpage comes together and seeing it's very complicated, complex, and very precise. I think these assignments are fun and I love seeing the progress from start to finish. The only problem I had was that my boarders didn't pop up and i don't know why. I typed everything in the exact way you did on the walkthrough video and even re-coded in it but still nothing, but besides that, everything else worked out fine!
