# Assignment-02
## Caleigh Moyer

I decided to take this class because it was one of the only classes available for summer session that counted for my major in art. I got many curve balls thrown to me this semester about my graduation status where I was suppose to be officially graduating this May, which I did walk, but I still had to take three more summer classes to officially graduate. So yes, everything in this class is like another language to me and I know hardly anything, but am looking forward to seeing what it's all about!

Three things that I've learned or hope to learn:
- I hope to learn more about the difference between the web and the internet
- I (am looking forward to learning) how to make a web page!
- I've learned what a directory and files are!
