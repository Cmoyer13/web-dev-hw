3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
I don't understand what happened to my text. It got cut off half way through and i don't know where I went wrong or how to change it. Also, the coding I did I copied it exactly how you did it, and still some things weren't changing on my page so I don't know how to fix that, but I did the best I could and besides the text, hopefully it still looks okay.
