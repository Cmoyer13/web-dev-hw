1. Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?
I learned everything new! Like I said in the beginning, this was my first web design class ever and I had no knowledge of how to code or do anything at all, so it was really cool putting a page together from scratch and seeing my progress along the way.

2. Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?
As above, everything! It was so cool seeing how colors and fonts go into html and how you can edit the width, height, style, just change one letter to a different font, etc. It was so fun learning so many new things over the past month and a half.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
I did keep the same layout as assignment 12 juts because it was easier for me to work with being such a newbie, but also, I did like the set up so I put my own little twist on it. For this assignment, I decided to pick the theme "hash kitchen" which is a real place that I just got hired at! It was still fresh to me, so thought it would be fun to create my own little beginner website for it. I sectioned up the for files, (index, about, contact, and services) and they all have something different. It was hard to think of what exactly to put in those sections, but hope I did an okay enough of a job. Overall, I enjoyed my time being in this course and did the best I could! I don't know if I will be doing any coding in the future, but it's nice to say that I know how to make a little page!
