## Caleigh Moyer

1. Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.
    Classes are also known as containers and you put classes inside a div. a div is a place for blocking and you have have multiple divs. You can put headings or paragraphs in divs as well. id's are what you use to title a div and I'm unsure what a span is.
2. What is "alt text," and why do we use it?
      An alt text describes the image on the page and it is used for the viewer to see the name description of the image.
3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
        This was a fun assignment! Very time consuming...a lot more coding but it was cool to see everything be put together!
